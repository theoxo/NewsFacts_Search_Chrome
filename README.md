# NewsFacts_Search_Chrome
Short Chrome extension to get Google results excluding the current website for a chosen string of text. Suggested use: double checking news "facts".

Not (yet) on the App Store as I'm sure there are already thousands of similar ones.

Just made for fun.

Looking to port to other browsers at some point.
